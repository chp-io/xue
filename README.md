# Xue USB 3.0 Debugger

Xue is a cross-platform driver for the USB 3.0 Debug Capability (DbC).
It is designed to be easy to embed into various environments, including
the Linux and Windows kernels and Bareflank and Xen hypervisors.

## Hardware Requirements

Note the debug *target* is the machine on which Xue itself runs, and
the debug *host* is the machine that connects to the target.
The target machine must have a PCI-based xHCI host controller that implements
the DbC. The host and target have to be connected with a USB debug cable.
